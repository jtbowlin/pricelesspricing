"layout" is the page template and CSS to use.  Just use default.

"title" is title of the page

"nav_order is for order in left pane.  Prioritizes capitals first unless 

"nav_exclude" is to keep file out of the left pane

"has_children" says if this is a parent folder or not.

"parent" to put on a child page identifying the parent page

"grandparent" to put a grandchild page (still need to identify parent too)

Note: Parent Folders need to have a corresponding .md file of the same name.  This shows when someone clicks on the parent in the nav.
